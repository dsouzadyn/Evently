### About the theme -
This year, the theme that we have taken up, is what we stand for, it's our PURPOSE, and that is to create something 'ZARA HATKE'.

Our college stands for it's dynamic nature of student and industry approach, and stands out amongst other colleges because of it's morals and ethics. To be different and make a change is what drives us students.

With every generation, comes change, comes revolution.
And in a world today where we are transcending innovations at all sorts of levels, whether it is
- ISRO launching it's 100th satellite, sometimes 20 at a time.
- the 13 year old who built a plane
- the two girls who travel around the world teaching Bhangra
- Tesla Roadster 2.0 going from 0-60kmph in 1.8s

No matter what sort of innovation it is, it stands out because it is Zara Hatke.

We present to you, Etamax 2018 - Zara Hatke.


As engineers we comprehend Eta as efficiency or ideality factor, and that is exactly what we intend to bring out in EtaMAX.


Hatke twists for the competitions - Technical and Cultural, we intend for our theme to gleam through every event and every student.

This constant urge to make a difference and bring about change is what drove us to theme our Etamax as 'Zara Hatke', and with it, we want to encourage students to risk for innovation, let their creativity flow and imagination wander, because only the craziest, most Hatke, ideas birth the best innovations.
