## About Etamax -
Known as CRITERIA up until 2002, ETAMAX is the inter-collegiate technocultural fest of FCRIT, Vashi, celebrating in it's 16th year of glory.
It focusses on igniting the minds of the students across the nation with a number of technical and cultural events. Being a completely student organised fest, we believe in practical learning. With our thoughtfully crafted events and workshops, we aim to motivate young minds to find creative solutions to real life problems.
Over the past decade, it has been groomed to become one of the biggest and most eagerly awaited college fests in Navi Mumbai with thousands of students participating each year.
It has seen celebrities like Shankar Mahadevan, Aditya Narayan and Nikhil Sajdev in attendance.

We invite you to share our vision and be a part of the legacy that carries forward excellence in every field.
